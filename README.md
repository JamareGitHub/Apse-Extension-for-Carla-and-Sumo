# Apse-Extension-for-Carla-and-Sumo

## Requirements / Pre-installation
* [Python 3.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [Sumo 1.20](https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/Downloads.php)
* [Carla 0.9.15](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/0.9.15/download/)

## Setup
1. Make sure that all requirements are installed and the PATH variable is correctly set.
2. Clone this repository to a location of your choice.
3. Install python packages using pip ("pip install -r .\requirements.txt").
4. Open "config.py" and setup your carla base path up to the folder "\WindowsNoEditor".
5. Copy content of setup_files into the Carla folder (copy the WindowsNoEditor folder over the one from carla, merge/ overwrite if promted)

## Update .rou files
* For the simulation to work you need to update the .rou.xml files in your CarlaBaseDir/Co-Simulation/Sumo/examples/rou folder.
* You can either use the files provided with this project or create your own files using randomTrips.py.
* You can find the method in the /tools folder in your SUMO installation.

```
python randomTrips.py -n "CarlaBaseDir/Co-Simulation/Sumo/examples/net/Townxx.net.xml" -e 7200 --route-file "CarlaBaseDir/Co-Simulation/Sumo/examples/rou/Townxx.rou.xml" --period 6 --validate 
```
* Using this command you will get the appropriate .rou file for the simulation. 
* You can change the duration of your simulation by setting the -e to a different value.
* Please make sure to also set  --period <FLOAT> (default 1) to your prefered value. 
  Note: Setting --period too low will cause the simulation to become overflooded which prevents the simulation from running correctly. You can avoid this by choosing a higher --period value.

## Running the Software
1. Run main.py to access the GUI ("python main.py")
2. In the GUI, select which components u want to run. To use the spectator, the Carla server is required
* If you want to run the spectator client at a later point, make sure you startet the Carla server and run spectator.py

## Keybinds spectator:

* q = Quit: Terminate the Spectator Client.
* n = Next: Switch to the next vehicle
* o = Overlay: Toggle the overlay that shows the name of the HUD and car (does not toggle the configured HUD!).
